## Bootstrap your Compass Catalog with from a Self-Hosted GitLab Instance

This script
1. Iterates over all your GitLab projects
2. Creates Compass Components for each of them
3. Connects your GitLab repo and Readme to that Component


## Install

You'll need node and npm to run this script

```
git clone https://github.com/acunniffe/compass-gitlab
cd compass-gitlab
npm install
```

## Credentials
Create a `.env` file and fill in the blanks. This file should be ignored by git already since it is in the `.gitignore`
```
# Replace these with your GitLab instance URL and access token
GITLAB_URL='<your gitlab>'
ACCESS_TOKEN='<an access token for gitlab scoped to group or individual>'
USER_EMAIL='<atlassian email>'
# https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
TOKEN='<atlassian token>'
# Add your subdomain here - find it from the url - e.g. https://<southwest>.atlassian.net
TENANT_SUBDOMAIN='<subdomain>'
# The UUID for your cloud site. This can be found in ARIs - look at the first uuid ari:cloud:compass:{cloud-uuid}
CLOUD_ID='<cloud uuid>'
```
## Do a dry run 
Preview what Repos the script will add to Compass. You don't need to wait until it's done - CTRL-C once you are comfortable. 
```
DRY_RUN=1 node index.js
```

Output:
```
Pulled projects 0 - 100
New component for https://gitlab.com/hyde.me/test_gb_less3_2 ... would be added hyde.me/test_gb_less3_2 (dry-run)
New component for https://gitlab.com/sachintomar009/reposetup ... would be added sachintomar009/reposetup (dry-run)
New component for https://gitlab.com/brianwilliamaldous/api-la ... would be added brianwilliamaldous/api-la (dry-run)
New component for https://gitlab.com/cloud-group3072118/timely ... would be added cloud-group3072118/timely (dry-run)
....

```


By default, all repos will be added. If you see some repos you don't want to import during the dry-run? Modify `index.js` to add some filters. There is a lot of metadata in the `project` variable. Read the API docs here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html

```javascript
for (const project of projects) {

    // need a filter, add one here!
    /*
    Example, skip user's 'home' repos
    if (project.path !== 'home')
     */
    if (true) {
        await putComponent(project.path_with_namespace, project.web_url, project.readme_url)
    }

}

```

## Ready to import?
Remove `DRY_RUN=1` to run the CLI in write mode.
```
node index.js
```

If your connection is interrupted, or you want to re-run after the initial import you can. It checks for duplicates and skips them:

```
Already added https://gitlab.com/VishnuprakashJ/home ... skipping
```

## Next steps

Once you're finished set up the on-prem webhook to link deployments, builds, etc to Compass. You only have to do this once (not once per Component) and Compass will associate the repo events with the Component they interact with.
